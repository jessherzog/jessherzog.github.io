	<h3>scheherazade <em>[ original text ]</em></h3>
	<p>
	tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake
	<br>and dress them in warm clothes again.
	<br>how it was late, and no one could sleep, the horses running
	<br>until they forget that they are horses.
	<br>it’s not like a tree where the roots have to end somewhere,
	<br>it’s more like a song on a policeman’s radio,
	<br>how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days
	<br>were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple to slice into pieces.
	<br>look at the light through the windowpane. that means it’s noon, that means
	<br>we’re inconsolable.
	<br>tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.
	<br>these, our bodies, possessed by light.
	<br>tell me we’ll never get used to it.
